  body_1: BII understands classrooms are dynamic environments and are ever changing in order to keep students interested and to 
          facilitate teachers' needs. Products that are durable and inviting promote learning outside the classroom in areas such as 
          libraries, lounges, computer labs, cafeterias, and hallways. BII’s knowledge and partnerships with K-12 and Higher Education 
          furniture manufacturers is key to keeping up with technological changes and the diverse learning styles of every student. As 
          technology and today’s work environments shift, it is increasingly important to prepare educational environments for the 
          collegiate and work environments students will eventually encounter.
  body_2: BII's experienced staff is available for onsite consultation. Services offered vary from complete building space planning, 
          furniture specification, project management and installation. BII’s diverse product offerings are available on multiple public 
          purchasing contracts such US Communities, National IPA, and KCDA, which allows BII to provide learning centers with the right 
          products for the best value.
